# huli-selenium
Automated testing environment for Java, JS, Python and C# developers

To get started download and install Docker on your machine!
Simply build the Dockerfile then run the image, or you can also use the docker-compose.yml file.

You will find two example scriptes written in python (example.py, google.py). To run any of those just use the CLI like so:
````
python3 example.py
````

An example for NodeJS is test.js. To run it use the CLI like so:
```
node test
```

Feel free to code your own tests in the language you prefer (Java, JS, C#, Python)!
